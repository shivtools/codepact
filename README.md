# < CodePact />

Make a pact, set your goals, and hold yourself accountable for sticking to them.

CodePact monitors your Github commits to make sure you're staying on track. 

If you meet your goal - you win.

If you don't meet your goal - humanity wins.


Getting started:
  - Sign in with Github
  - Choose your pact type(s)
  - Set the stakes
  - Pick your charity


> CodePact  makes sure you stay productive and work on your projects.
> If you commit the lines you promised to in your pact - you keep your savings.
> If you fail - then your lack of productivity funds the charity of your choosing.
> Challenge your friends and see who can stay on track! or see who ends up donating their life savings to charity. You set the stakes!
